Research Projects and Academic Work
=====

* __Cryptography - University of Exeter__
   * At the University of Exeter I was lucky enough to work with Dr Marasingha on cryptologic problems. Not only is cryptology something I have always found deeply interesting, but after learning how its key principles are used in modern technology I understand how pivotal it is to the future of information technology. In this project I programmed two collision algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm problem: Baby-Step Giant-Step and Pohlig-Hellman to crack the Diffie-Hellman.
<br> Supervisor: Gihan Marasingha. 

* __Mathematics History and Culture - University of Exeter__
  * I enhanced my skills crafting concisely written and thoroughly researched essays through academic assignments, and further developed these abilities by preparing and delivering a comprehensive presentation on related material to undergraduate mathematicians. 
 <br> Supervisor: Peter Ashwin. 

* __Exploring, Comparing and Developing Effective Methods for Teaching Mathematical Proofs - University of Exeter__
   * In this project I used critical path analysis to identify critical activities as well as to help track our progress through the timeline of the project. Moreover, I designed a 45-minute workshop for young maths enthusiasts instructing them how to build their own mathematical proofs from scratch. I thoroughly enjoyed the level of control I had in this project and that I was given freedom to innovate and implement my own ideas. Evidence from my workshops were analysed in R and collected in a guide for educators and learners where we highlighted the methods which were most effective in increasing students' long-term understanding of proofs and ability to create their own mathematical proofs.
<br> Supervisor: Barrie Cooper.
