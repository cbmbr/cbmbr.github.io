Employment History and Volunteering 
=====
* __Content Editor – Stairway Learning (2019 - 2020)__
  * As a freelance Content Editor, I set my focus on creating engaging interactive A-Level Maths lessons that introduce complex topics by presenting these maths problems as puzzle games: challenging but fun! I excelled at breaking down various abstract ideas into smaller chunks and make numerous notoriously hard topics more accessible to young people. In addition, freelancing strengthened my time management and strategic planning skills.

* __STEM Tuition and Outreach (2016 to Present)__
  * Through Maths and Physics tutoring and numerous STEM outreach events, I have become extremely adept at communicating with enthusiasm and clarity, allowing me to connect with and inspire people from all walks of life. Moreover, I maintained a network of clients over the years that reflects my professional customer service and sought-after interpersonal skills. I have high standards for myself and I always try to exceed customer's expectations by going above and beyond. My positive attitude and flexible approach translates into extremely positive feedback, a high rate of customer retention and word-to-mouth recommendations.  

* __Marie Curie Charity Shop (2015 - 2017)__
  * I volunteered for two years at a local Marie Curie Cancer Care shop. Most of the customers who patronised this charity shop were regulars who not only enjoyed our high-quality affordable products but also valued the attention to detail of each and every volunteer like me who would take the time to understand what each customer's needs were. Our service reached beyond selling the product, that is, our area of concern also extended into how the customer felt leaving the shop: listened to, cared for and invigorated.
