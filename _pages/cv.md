I am a creative problem solver with great attention to detail. As a team player who is also incredibly self-motivated, I am always looking to collaborate with and learn from my colleagues. I am currently seeking a professional job in digital security where I can build upon my analytical skill set. 

Education
======
* __BSc. Mathematics  –  University of Exeter (2014 - 2019)__
  * Modules include: Analysis, Differential Equations, Programming for Mathematics, Number Theory, Cryptography and Linear Algebra. 
* __Data Scientist Bootcamp – Learning People Global (January - March 2021)__
   * I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship for this Data Science programme which I have been awarded in March 2021. This exciting course has helped me apply my knowledge of mathematics to complex real world problems using data-driven solutions. 


Skills & competencies
======
* Numeracy - proficient in pure maths and statistics 
* MS Office –  proficiency in Excel, Word and PowerPoint and web-based programmes.
* SQL –  used for querying and managing relational databases.
* Python –  used for implementing data analysis as well as various raspberry pi projects.
* R –  used statistical methods in R for various projects including predictive analytics.
* Linux –  used for personal use and used Scientific Linux for various academic projects.
* MATLAB –  used for various assignments and personal projects such as neural networks.
* CompTIA A+, ITF+, Network+ – studying in my own time as I am due to sit exams in summer.

Employment History and Volunteering 
======

* __Cryptography - University of Exeter__
   * At the University of Exeter I was lucky enough to work with Dr Marasingha on cryptologic problems. Not only is cryptology something I have always found deeply interesting, but after learning how its key principles are used in modern technology I understand how pivotal it is to the future of information technology. In this project I programmed two collision algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm problem: Baby-Step Giant-Step and Pohlig-Hellman to crack the Diffie-Hellman.
<br> Supervisor: Gihan Marasingha. 

* __Mathematics History and Culture - University of Exeter__
  * I enhanced my skills crafting concisely written and thoroughly researched essays through academic assignments, and further developed these abilities by preparing and delivering a comprehensive presentation on related material to undergraduate mathematicians. 
 <br> Supervisor: Peter Ashwin. 

* __Exploring, Comparing and Developing Effective Methods for Teaching Mathematical Proofs - University of Exeter__
   * In this project I used critical path analysis to identify critical activities as well as to help track our progress through the timeline of the project. Moreover, I designed a 45-minute workshop for young maths enthusiasts instructing them how to build their own mathematical proofs from scratch. I thoroughly enjoyed the level of control I had in this project and that I was given freedom to innovate and implement my own ideas. Evidence from my workshops were analysed in R and collected in a guide for educators and learners where we highlighted the methods which were most effective in increasing students' long-term understanding of proofs and ability to create their own mathematical proofs.
<br> Supervisor: Barrie Cooper.
