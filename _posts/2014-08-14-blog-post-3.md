Back in the day when passing written notes around in class was still popular I taught my friends to use this cipher. 
It is the easiest of all ciphers and offers virtually zero security, but using this cipher made it harder for interceptors to read the message *ever so slightly*. 
<br>

This cipher is called the substitution cipher but is also known as A1Z26. 


> For each letter of the alphabet we will assign a number so that each letter maps to a counting number. <br>
> So A=1, B=2, C=3, ... , Z=26.

It really is that simple! 


<h3> Encryption Function </h3>

Here I am using ASCII characters between 65 ('A') and 94 ('Z') so this alphabet will be the 26 *uppercase* letters.

<pre>
def substitutioncipher(plaintext):  
    plaintext = plaintext.upper(); # Converting plaintext message to uppercase 
    plaintext_list = [0]*len(plaintext); # Initialising an empty vector for splitting plaintext letters
    encrypted_message = [0]*len(plaintext_list); # Initialising an empty vector for converting each letter
    plaintext_list = [char for char in plaintext] # Splitting into individual letters
    for i in range(0, len(plaintext_list)):  # Converting each letter into a number
        number_as_ascii = ord(plaintext_list[i]) 
        encrypted_message[i] = number_as_ascii - 64 # Subtract 64 so that 1 maps to 'A' instead of 0
    return encrypted_message
</pre>


But it would be just as easy to do this with _lowercase_ characters. All you need to do from here is: 

 * Change line 2 to **plaintext = plaintext.lower();**
 * Change line 8 to **ascii_num[i] = number_as_ascii - 96**

The reason for the second change is that the lowercase alphabet in ASCII is between 97 ('a') and 123 ('z') so we need to take away 96 to map 'a' to 1 instead of 0. 


<h3> Checking it works </h3>

Basic words seem to work okay.

Notice that running substitutioncipher("HELLOWORLD") and substitutioncipher("HELLO WORLD") we get similar outputs but the second array has a negative number representing the character for 'space'. What if we try other interesting characters?

All this is okay though because our decrypt function is able to handle this! 

<h3> Decryption function </h3>

Here is the decryption function. We can give it an "encrypted" array and it should give us the original string back. 
<pre>
def decrypt_substitution_cipher(int_array):
    message = [0]*len(int_array);
    for i in range(0, len(int_array)):  
        message[i] = int_array[i] + 64 # for lowercase letters use 96 and for uppercase letters use 64
    decrypted_message = [0]*len(message) 
    for i in range(0, (len(message))):   # Converting to letters 
        decrypted_message[i] = chr(message[i]);  
    sep = ""; # Converting to words
    return sep.join(decrypted_message)
</pre>

For each of the arrays above, we have an output of:

Good luck decrypting this!
