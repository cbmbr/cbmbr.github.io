The Caesar Cipher is also a substitution cipher. It also offers zero security and is equally vulnerable to attacks as the A1Z26 cipher. But in order to crack this cipher we need to understand it so let's build one.
<br>

> The Caesar cipher works by using a **shift** (or **translation**) on top of A1Z26.


In A1Z26 we have A=1, B=2, ... , Y=25, Z=26. <br> But using this shift technique we could instead shift each letter one number along so that A=2, B=3, ... , Y=26. 


_What happens to Z?_ We just wrap it around so Z=1. 

Say we wanted to shift 10 letters along to the right: we just add 10 to each number. Our new alphabet would then be A=11, B=12, ... , Y=9, Z=10. 
That means for Y we add 25 and 10 then we subtract 26 from the result in order to wrap it around. This is the equivalent of counting in a 12-hour clock where 13:00 is the same as 1:00. With the Caesar cipher the clock we are counting with has 26 hours. This accounts for each letter of the alphabet.

I've built this cipher using snippets of code from the A1Z26 cipher. The main difference is the Caesar cipher requires an input for the shift (also known as the key). I designed this in a way that both positive and negative integers are acceptable as key. In reality though there are only 25 unique ways to shift the english alphabet which means this cipher is perfect for brute force attacks! 


Here are some examples. Note the Caesar cipher without any shifts gives us the A1Z26 cipher!

In a future post I will explain how to brute force the Caesar Cipher (and A1Z26 at the same time!).
