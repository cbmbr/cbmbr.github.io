> We must know, we will know!  



Hilbert's speech of 1930 has struck a chord with many people even to this day - I am obviously a huge fan! <br>
In this post I will be talking about non-euclidean geometry and formalism. I hope to expand on Hilbert's 23 Problems and Godel's theorems in the next poxt.

What was the influence of non-Euclidean geometry on Hilbert’s formalist approach to the foundations of mathematics? 
==========
Felix Klein was perhaps the first to draw a distinction between three broadly different modes of thinking about mathematics; he goes as far as naming these groups logicians, formalists and intuitionists, though his classification differs slightly from modern use [E2:p957-8]. 

Here we will interpret formalism as Hilbert’s finitist consistency program. Hilbert’s response to the foundational crisis of mathematics is known as Hilbert's Program and it calls for a “formalisation of all of mathematics in axiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization of mathematics is consistent.” The consistency proof itself was constrained by what he called “finitary” methods, the character of which ensures a satisfactory justification of classical mathematics [Z1]. Hilbert argues that proceeding axiomatically is not only a matter of working rigorously from initial presuppositions but requires deep conceptual organisation [W1]. Hilbert’s insight lay in distinguishing between ‘structural axioms’ and ‘foundational axioms’ [V1:p36]. Moreover, by turning the concept of proof itself into an object of investigation, he could thus consider problems ‘syntactically’ rather than ‘semantically’. Proof-theory is seen as a continuation of Hilbert’s original program after Godel showed that it is not possible to formalise all true mathematical statements within a formal system (that is, a finite system of axioms furnished with rules of inference which allow one to generate new theorems). 
There are indeed many influences to Hilbert’s formalist approach to the foundations of mathematics; in this essay we will be looking specifically at non-Euclidean geometry and considering the influence of this branch of mathematics in Hilbert’s advancements in mathematics. Therefore, we will make a brief recapitulation of some key advances made in that area. Some concepts like completeness and consistency, which are recurrent in Hilbert’s writings, are closely connected to questions raised by non-Euclidean geometry. The truth and provability of Euclid’s parallel postulate is just one of many important questions raised by considering the foundations of geometry, like for example questions on the nature of an axiomatic system, the possibility of alternative geometries and also the role of intuition in mathematical thought [E2:p649]. 


Non-Euclidean geometry begins with the efforts to remove doubts about Euclid’s parallel postulate. There were two main approaches: one was to find a more self-evident replacement axiom and the other was to deduce Euclid’s fifth postulate from the remaining axioms in the Elements. Gerolamo Saccheri considered two alternatives to the parallel axiom; the first could be shown to contradict itself, and the second, called the acute-angle hypothesis, produced interesting results that led Saccheri to conclude it must be false and he thus confidently published ‘Euclid freed from all imperfections’ in 1733 [G1:p54][K2:p867]. His proof is invalid, but it is significant that he was not the first or last mathematician to be misled by the vague language of points, lines, ‘at infinity’, etc. [G1:p62].


The realisation that the parallel postulate does not necessarily hold true, that is, there exist alternative axioms that produce logically consistent mathematical systems, encouraged mathematicians to revise their understanding of the relationship of mathematics to the physical world and to question the foundations of mathematics itself [K2:p861]. Nicolai Lobachevsky and Janos Bolyai each independently created and published an avowed non-Euclidean geometry in the 19th century, though credit should also be extended to the work of Lambert, Schweikart, Taurinus, Gauss and many others [B1:p44,p64,p75-9][Also: B1:p55,p62.E1:p296.G1:p69]. Saccheri deserves acknowledgement for the practical development of the consequences of a system of axioms containing an alternative to the parallel postulate, however the recognition that there can exist geometries different to Euclid’s is normally attributed to Klugel and Lambert but most especially Gauss [K2:p869][E1:p297]. Klugel knew of Saccheri’s work and with his 1763 dissertation, inspired Lambert who noted that “any body of hypothesis which did not lead to a contradiction offered a possible geometry” in his 1766 Theorie der Parallellinien [K2:p868] Gauss is perhaps the first to explicitly doubt the veracity of the parallel axiom; being acquainted with Schweikart’s astral geometry and Lobachevsky’s imaginary geometry he writes to a friend in 1846 that “since 1792” he has had “the same conviction” [E1:p305]. 


Riemann distinguished between topological and metric properties of space, which enabled him to generalise traditional geometry [E2:p650]. He was the first to recognise that not only the parallel postulate should be questioned but also many other implicit assumptions made by Euclid that Riemann stated explicitly [G1:p129]. The theme of questioning concealed assumptions is picked up by Hilbert many times. Contrary to previous thought, Riemann showed the existence of a system of geometry compatible with the hypothesis of the obtuse angle was possible if the assumption of the straight line being ‘infinite’ was replaced by a more general notion of ‘unboundedness’ [B1:p142]. 


In his 1868 ‘Essay on the interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry’ Beltrami connects Lobachevsky and Bolyai’s non-Euclidean geometry with Riemann’s geometry and reduces the problem of the consistency of the axioms of non-Euclidean geometry to that of the consistency of the axioms of Euclidean geometry [R5][R4]. It should be noted Beltrami’s procedure, now known as ‘creating a model of the axioms’, was the first approach of its kind [G1:137]. His work was completed by Klein who in 1871-1873 published a series of papers titled ‘On the so-called non-Euclidean geometry’ categorising non-Euclidean geometries into several types of hyperbolic and elliptic geometries; additionally, describing projective-geometrical models for each [E3:p957]. This reinforced the idea that projective geometry was indeed the most fundamental geometry as it was based on the fewest first principles [G2:p48]. In a corollary he established that any contradiction appearing in non-Euclidean geometry must also necessarily appear in Euclidean geometry [R1:p59]. 


In the late 19th century, as non-Euclidean geometry received a more rigorous treatment, the implicit assumptions of Euclid could not be overlooked and the desire to separate abstract mathematics from spatial intuition can be felt more intensely. A famous remark about swapping the words ‘points, lines and planes’ for ‘tables, chairs and mugs’ – the intention of the message being that it is possible to eradicate from one’s arguments terms which ‘smuggle in meanings’ –  was perhaps most profoundly appreciated by David Hilbert [G2:p49][K1:797]. 


Hilbert was born in 1862 in Konigsberg, where he attended university (being a member of staff from 1886 to 1895). Hilbert attended lectures by Adolf Hurwitz on modular functions and Ferdinand von Lindemann on geometry; the latter becomes Hilbert’s thesis advisor in 1884 [R2]. Having passed the oral examination, Hilbert’s final ordeal was a kind of ‘debate’ held on February 7, 1885, which entailed the defence two propositions of the candidate’s own choosing and Hilbert argued “that the objections to Kant’s theory of the a priori nature of the arithmetical judgements are unfounded” [R1:p16-17]. 


Hilbert develops a close friendship with Hurwitz, as well as fellow student Hermann Minkowski, a man with optimism to match Hilbert’s and who was to suggest to him the theme of the infamous 1900 speech [R3][G2:p57]. The three young men develop a close friendship and frequently go on walks to “the apple tree” in order to discuss mathematics; in 1886 Hurwitz and Hilbert set themselves the goal of “a systematic exploration” of mathematics [R1:p14,p28]. Hurwitz, who wrote his doctoral dissertation under Felix Klein’s supervision (also the case for Lindemann), encouraged Hilbert to make a research visit to Leipzig – in particular, to see Klein, then famous for his Erlangen Programme, where he proposes a unification of all geometries. Hilbert attends Klein’s lectures; he also presents a vortrag (lecture) during one his seminars, which Klein found impressive [R1:p18-9]. In 1895, on Klein’s invitation Hilbert accepted a professorship in Gottingen, the university of Gauss, Dirichlet and Riemann, where he remained until his death [E2:p1088][K1:p798]. 


Hilbert’s research into the foundations of mathematics can be split into two periods separated by over a decade. Here will consider an important segment of Hilbert’s life, dated between roughly 1898 to 1903, which entails his focused research into the foundations of geometry and the axiomatic method, as well as a few expeditions into the foundations of arithmetic [E2:p1088]. In 1899 Hilbert authored Grundlagen der Geometrie (The Foundations of Geometry), which was initially a record of lectures presented at Gottingen in 1898-1899; the book ran to seven editions in his lifetime, the purpose of which was to describe his “attempt to choose for geometry a simple and complete set of independent axioms” and deduce theorems in a way that shows exactly which axioms underlie the demonstration [H1:p1][K1:p797]. He goes further in discussing the mutual independence and compatibility of the given system of axioms. He outlines his task as constituting “a logical analysis of our intuition”, though the question of whether spatial intuition has an a priori or a posteriori character is not expounded on [V1:p30]. 


Hilbert notes in the introduction that geometry needs only “a small number of simple, fundamental principles” [H1:p1]. He then postulates the existence of three systems of things (points, lines and planes) and defines axioms by the relationship between the elements composing each system [H1:p1-15][E2:p1092]. He then arranges these axioms in five groups, saying “each of these groups expresses, by itself, certain related fundamental facts of our intuition” [H1:p2]. In most recent versions there are eight axioms of connection regarding collinearity and intersection, four axioms of order that concern the arrangements of points and five axioms of congruence that concern geometric equivalence. Furthermore, there are two axioms of continuity and the axiom of parallels [W2]. Interestingly Hilbert adds in a remark in a later French translation the Axiom of Completeness, an insight which is never used in the Grundlagen but certainly “merits particular attention from a theoretical point of view”. This axiom establishes that if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid then adding other elements to the generalised system of points, straight lines and planes would “form a new geometry” [H1:p15]. Another interesting revision to note was the elimination of axiom II-4 due to an article by Eliakim Moore in 1902 proving its redundancy. 


Hilbert introduces the idea of compatibility and mutual independence of the axioms. To show the five groups of axioms are not contradictory, Hilbert shows “it is sufficient to construct a geometry where all the five groups are fulfilled” [H1:p17]. He does exactly that for non-Euclidean geometry, constructing a domain in which all other axioms are satisfied but the parallel axiom; but goes further, showing also non-Archimedean geometry, and what he terms non-Pascalian geometry are also valid constructions [H1:p19,69]. It is noteworthy that like Beltrami, Hilbert is showing a consistency proof that is relative to another branch of mathematics. He uses model-theoretic notions to provide an arithmetical interpretation to the geometric axioms, however notes that ‘recourse to another fundamental discipline does not seems to be allowed when the foundations of arithmetic are at issue’ [E2:p1091]. 


Through the arithmetisation of analysis and the axioms of Peano, most of mathematics had gained a strict axiomatic foundation. Hilbert’s Grundlagen is an extension of the axiomatic methodology to geometry, though perhaps more importantly, we see Hilbert’s preoccupation with showing the consistency of his axioms, and “further, that the system of axioms is adequate to prove all geometrical propositions”, an idea that echoes again in Hilbert’s later work in the foundations of mathematics [B2:p657][E2:p1092]. Although he does not consider the idea of completeness of his axiomatic system (he was ‘virtually certain’ that it was complete), Hilbert concern himself with consistency, where his approach is very similar to previous mathematicians [K1:p800]. He does not demonstrate independence completely but succeeds in showing the different groups of axioms being independent.
